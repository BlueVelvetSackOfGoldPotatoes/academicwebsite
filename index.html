    <p>Hey, my name is Gonçalo. I am currently the head of an engineering team that builds Machine Learning ap-
plications at Pennie Solutions - a startup based in Groningen. I program, develop
data analysis pipelines and build models for clients following the consultancy tra-
dition. I am also studying AI as my MSc at RUG, the Netherlands (I have a BSc of Science in AI). </p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I was editor and head of content for the COVER magazine, Groningen University
study Association for Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Computer Science and Computational
Cognitive Science (MSc and BSc) students, where I wrote several articles. I also
write for other student magazines and journals. At COVER, I fostered key events
that had an average attendance of 50 people. One such event was the ‘COVER-
Talks’, where I invited and spoke to experts of different ﬁelds (e.g. Joscha Bach -
Cognitive Science PhD, and Stephen Wolfram - Physicist and Computer Scientist).
Another example of a successful plan was the ‘BootCamps’, where experts were
invited to teach students extracurricular skills (e.g. studying effectively, and men-
tal health during Covid-19). A hackathon co-organized with AIMED - association
for AI and Medical students of Groningen, consisting in the exploratory analysis
of two large Covid-19 related datasets by multidisciplinary teams of Medical re-
search MSc students, Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Computer Science MSc students.
I wrote the example notebooks for the competition (https://bit.ly/3x9Bceh). I also
co-organized a symposium on accountability, responsibility and transparency in
Computer Science and AI (Covers A.R.T. Symposium) featuring digital security ex-
pert and Wiki-leaks co-creator Daniel Domscheit-Berg.</p>
