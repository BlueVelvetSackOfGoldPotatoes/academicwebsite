            Hey. My name is Gonçalo, currently living with my family in Zurich, Switzerland. I am also the Co-Founder of Prismus.ai, where I am building the the next data layer that will change how science and industry interact. And once that works well enough, build the models of the future that will transform information into knowledge. In my free time, I run, but I also love hiking, as well as cracking open some rocks to see if they have any treasure inside. I also have a Bachelors and Masters in AI. I finished my bachelors with a thesis and an internship from the cardiology department at the UMCG, the Netherlands; and my Masters in Deep Learning at the Pollice Research Group of the Stratingh Institute for Chemistry, University of Groningen, the Netherlands where I started the data pipeline that turned into Prismus: consuming, transforming, and interpreting scientific data into actionable causal chains. I worked for 5 years as an AI research engineer for the Icelandic Institute for Intelligent Machines (IIIM), Reykjavík, where I became a product owner and manager of the AI team where I supervised 3 full time engineers and several interns throughout the years. Before that, I worked for 2 years as an AI junior scientist and data scientist for DASH, UMCG, the Netherlands, where I taught at the DASH Summer and Winter Schools, mentoring students and researchers in ML techniques, and headed several research projects with real medical data and medical personnel to interpret and understand the underlying mechanisms of disease.
          </p>
          <p>
          I am particularly interested in recent advancements in Deep Learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques such as temporal and causal RAG, Agentic Multi-Agent Systems, and multimodal models like JEPA. These innovations promise to significantly enhance research connectivity within research organizations, potentially bringing us closer to solving many rich and complex problems - can't wait to see where we'll be in the next few years!

          What excites you?
