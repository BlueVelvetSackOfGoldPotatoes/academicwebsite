          Hi! My name is Gonçalo. I'm a father, husband, and AI professional currently based in Zurich, Switzerland. With a Bachelor's and Master's degree specializing in Artificial Intelligence, I have been dedicating my time to designing and training intelligent systems - though admittedly, none quite as clever as a toddler (they set a high bar!).
          </p>
          <p>
          I earned my Bachelor's degree with a thesis and internship at the ML cardiology department of the UMCG in the Netherlands. Following this, I completed my Master's degree in Deep Learning at the PolliceLab of Artificial Organic Chemistry within the Stratingh Institute for Chemistry at the University of Groningen.
          </p>
          <p>
          Currently, I am a team leader at IIIM, an NPO that aims at building a bridge between academia and industry to help accelerate the safe application of AI solutions to real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
          I am particularly interested in recent advancements in Deep Learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Agentic AI, and multimodal models. These innovations promise to significantly enhance research connectivity within research organizations, potentially bringing us closer to solving many rich and complex problems - can't wait to see where we'll be in the next few years!
          </p>
          <p>
          What excites you?
