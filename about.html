            Hi! My name is Gonçalo -  I am a father and a husband, currently living with my family in Zurich, Switzerland. I am also the Co-Founder & CAIO of Prismus.ai, where I am building the next generation of agentic AI sales companions for scientific sales, and, once that works well enough, for anybody else's sales. I love hiking in search of crisp water springs to jump in, as well as cracking open some rocks to see if they have any treasure inside. I also have a Bachelors and Masters in AI. I finished my bachelors with a thesis and an internship from the cardiology department at the UMCG, the Netherlands; and my Masters in Deep Learning at the Pollice Research Group of the Stratingh Institute for Chemistry, University of Groningen, the Netherlands. I know a thing or two about AI and ML as well as chemistry and medical sciences thanks to dozens of international research and engineering projects that I was and am lucky enough to be apart of. I am also a consultant for IIIM (shoutout to Marta, Kristinn, and Mario for being awesome people to work with).
          </p>
          <p>
            I am most excited about the ongoing developments in RAG, Agentic AI, and Multimodal models and can't wait to see their impact in the development of research connectomes within medical organizations - I think these advancements are taking us closer and closer to one day solving disease (yes, all of it!). 
          </p>
          <p>
            What are you excited about?
          </p>
