    <header><h2 style="text-align: center;">O-truth: Truth as an Approximation of Observer Models to Real Space Objects</h2></header>

      <p>
          Truth is illusive. Regardless, it is a foundational concept across domains of knowledge, from scientific inquiry to logical reasoning. Traditional definitions often lack the generalizability required to encompass the diversity of opinions encountered in different contexts. This paper introduces a comprehensive mathematical framework aimed at defining truth in a manner that is both generalizable and applicable to a wide range of statements, including empirical scientific truths and abstract logical propositions.
      </p>
      <p>
          Nothing contained in this paper is truly novel. In a way, it is simply an explicit statement of what has been implicit in the ages-old efforts of physics as a field of inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
          The framework leverages Many-Worlds Logic to represent possible models within a computational space, integrates information theory to quantify discrepancies between models and reality, and accounts for observer effects and quantum limitations. By formalizing these elements, we believe that the theory provides a robust mechanism for measuring truth as the convergence of models towards an underlying reality, acknowledging that absolute truth remains unattainable due to inherent uncertainties and observer constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>
          Furthermore, we emphasize that no real-space variable can be known in its absolute sense. Our instruments and senses provide only approximations to unknown “true” values. The act of defining a variable such as “mass” or “temperature” already presupposes models and calibrations that recursively invoke still other variables, culminating in an infinite regress or at least an iterative refinement. Thus, each “measurement” is itself a model-based inference about some deeper reality.
